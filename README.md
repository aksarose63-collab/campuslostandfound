### Project Description

Campus Lost and Found Portal is a web-based application that helps students report and track lost and found items within the campus. Users can log in, upload item details with images, and claim items. The system also includes a reward points feature to encourage honesty and community participation.


### The Problem statement

Students in college campuses frequently lose personal belongings such as ID cards, wallets, books, and electronic devices. There is no centralized system to report and track these items, which makes it difficult to reconnect lost items with their rightful owners.

### The Solution

We developed a web-based platform where students can create an account, report lost or found items, upload images, and track item status. The system allows users to claim items and confirm returns. A reward points system encourages students to honestly return lost belongings.
